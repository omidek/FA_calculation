Detailed description of the method used here for analysis of fluctuating asymmetry can be found in the paper: "Ekrami et al., Measuring asymmetry from high-density 3D surface scans: An application to human faces, 2018"

Some of the functions uploaded here are made by other parties and are available online. Wherever any of these functions are used in the code, the source is mentioned.

You can start the registeration code by running "main_example.m"

An example of calculation of individual DA scores (F-DA) and obtaining FA values corrected for individual DA (C-FA) is presented in the file "c-fa_example.m". A set of sample faces are provided "sample_faces.m" for testing the code. These faces are synthetically produced based on a weighted average of 10 random real faces.
